One away

There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character, remove a character or replace a character.
Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away.

eg:

pale, ple -> true
pales, pale -> true 
pale, bale -> true
pale, bake -> false
