Linked Lists - Front Back Split

Write a FrontBackSplit() function that takes one list and splits it into two sublists â€” one for the front half, and one for the back half. 
If the number of elements is odd, the extra element should go in the front list. For example, FrontBackSplit() on the list 2 -> 3 -> 5 -> 7 -> 11 -> null should yield the two lists 2 -> 3 -> 5 -> null and 7 -> 11 -> null. 
Getting this right for all the cases is harder than it looks. You will probably need special case code to deal with lists of length < 2 cases.
